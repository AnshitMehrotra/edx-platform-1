        A numerical input problem accepts a line of text input from the student, and evaluates
        the input for correctness based on its numerical value.

        The system can handle several types of characters, including basic operators, fractions, exponents, and common constants such as "i". You can refer learners to "Entering Mathematical and Scientific Expressions" in the edX Guide for Students for more information.

        >>Enter the numerical value of Pi:<<
        = 3.14159 +- .02 {{Pi represented to 5 decimal places is 3.14159}}

        >>Enter the approximate value of 502*9:<<
        = 4518 +- 15% {{502*9 is 4518}}

        >>Enter the number of fingers on a human hand<<
        = 5 {{Most humans have 5 fingers on each of their hands.}}

        [explanation]
        Pi, or the the ratio between a circle's circumference to its diameter, is an irrational
        number known to extreme precision. It is value is approximately equal to 3.14.

        Although you can get an exact value by typing 502*9 into a calculator, the result
        will be close to 500*10, or 5,000. The grader accepts any response within 15% of
        the true value, 4518, so that you can use any estimation technique that you like.

        >>The square of what number is -100?<<

        = 10*i 

        [explanation]
        The sun is 93,000,000, or 9.3*10^6, miles away from Earth.
        -100 is the square of 10 times the imaginary number, i.

    <problem>

    <p>In a numerical input problem, learners enter numbers or a specific and
    relatively simple mathematical expression. Learners enter the response in
    plain text, and the system then converts the text to a symbolic expression
    that learners can see below the response field.</p>

    <p>The system can handle several types of characters, including basic
    operators, fractions, exponents, and common constants such as i. You can 
    refer learners to 
    <a href="http://edx.readthedocs.org/projects/edx-guide-for-students/en/latest/SFD_mathformatting.html" target="_blank">
    Entering Mathematical and Scientific Expressions</a> in the <i>edX Guide for
    Students</i> for information about how to enter text into the field.</p>
    <p>When you add the problem, be sure to select <strong>Settings</strong> 
    to specify a <strong>Display Name</strong> and other values that apply.</p>

    <p>You can use the following example problems as models.</p>
    <p>_____________________________________________________________________________</p>

    <p>Enter the numerical value of Pi:
       <numericalresponse answer="3.14159">
           <responseparam type="tolerance" default=".02" />
           <formulaequationinput label="Enter the numerical value of Pi" />
           <correcthint>Pi represented to 5 decimal places is 3.14159</correcthint>
       </numericalresponse>
    </p>
    <p>Enter the approximate value of 502*9:
       <numericalresponse answer="$computed_response">
           <responseparam type="tolerance" default="15%"/>
           <formulaequationinput label="Enter the approximate value of 502 times 9"/>
           <correcthint>502*9 is 4518</correcthint>
       </numericalresponse>
    </p>

    <p>Enter the number of fingers on a human hand:
       <numericalresponse answer="5">
           <formulaequationinput label="Enter the number of fingers on a human hand"/>
           <correcthint>Most humans have 5 fingers on each of their hands.</correcthint>
